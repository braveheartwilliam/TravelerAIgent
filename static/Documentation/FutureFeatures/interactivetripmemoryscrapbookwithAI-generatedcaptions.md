- Creates lasting, accessible trip memories

## Technical Design

### Architecture Components

#### Frontend
- Drag-and-drop scrapbook editor interface
- Customizable templates and themes
- Preview renderer for different device sizes
- Animation system for interactive elements
- Export options (PDF, interactive web version, social media snippets)

#### Backend
- Media processing pipeline for photos and videos
- OpenAI integration for caption and narrative generation
- Layout suggestion engine based on content analysis
- PDF/web rendering service
- Sharing and permissions management

### Data Requirements
- User trip photos and videos
- Trip metadata (locations, dates, activities)
- User's personal notes and highlights
- Emotion detection from media content
- Cultural and historical context for visited locations

### User Experience Flow
1. User selects a completed trip to create a scrapbook
2. System analyzes media and suggests initial layouts based on content
3. AI generates preliminary captions and narrative text
4. User reviews and edits AI-generated content
5. User customizes design elements (themes, fonts, colors)
6. System creates interactive elements (maps, timelines, panoramas)
7. User previews the scrapbook on different devices
8. User exports and shares the final product

## Implementation Plan
