# Augmented Reality Destination Preview with Cultural Insights

## Overview
This feature enhances trip planning by providing immersive augmented reality previews of destinations with rich cultural context. Users can virtually "visit" their planned destinations before they travel, gaining a better understanding of local customs, landmarks, and cultural significance.

## User Value
- Reduces pre-trip anxiety by familiarizing travelers with destinations
- Enhances cultural appreciation and respectful tourism
- Improves trip planning by allowing visualization of sites and their proximity
- Creates anticipation and excitement for the upcoming trip

## Technical Design

### Architecture Components

#### Frontend
- AR Viewer component built with React Three Fiber and AR.js
- Cultural information overlay system
- Gesture controls for navigation and interaction
- Progressive loading system for 3D assets

#### Backend
- Cultural insights API integration (Google Knowledge Graph, Wikipedia API)
- 3D model and panorama storage system
- Asset optimization pipeline for mobile performance
- Location-based content delivery network

### Data Requirements
- 3D models of major landmarks
- 360Â° panoramic images for immersive viewing
- Cultural data including:
  - Historical significance
  - Local customs and etiquette
  - Language phrases relevant to landmarks
  - Cultural context for architectural features

### User Experience Flow
1. User selects a destination from their trip itinerary
2. System loads the AR preview interface
3. User can view destination from different angles:
   - Street view navigation
   - Landmark exploration
   - Cultural hotspots highlighted
4. Tapping on cultural hotspots reveals information cards
5. Audio narration option for hands-free exploration
6. Save favorite viewpoints to revisit later

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Integrate basic AR viewer using existing libraries
- Implement simplified 3D model loading for major landmarks
- Create basic UI for navigation between viewpoints
- Establish data pipeline for cultural information

### Phase 2: Enrichment
- Add cultural context layers and information cards
- Implement audio narration system
- Enhance gesture controls and interaction model
- Optimize performance for mobile devices

### Phase 3: Social and AI Enhancement
- Add capability to share AR experiences with co-travelers
- Implement AI-driven cultural insights based on user preferences
- Add personalized recommendations within the AR experience
- Create "virtual guides" with local expertise
