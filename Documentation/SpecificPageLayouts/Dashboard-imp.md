   - Fixed at the top of the page
   - Provides global navigation

2. **Main Content Area**
   - Top Breadcrumbs
   - Heading Section
   - Features Grid (FeatureCards)
   - Action Buttons
   - Guided Creation Section
   - Bottom Breadcrumbs

3. **Footer**
   - Fixed at the bottom of the page
   - Provides copyright and links

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**
   - Protected layout checks authentication status
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
   - Provides user data to child components

2. **Navigation State**
   - Navigation store manages active state
   - Components subscribe to navigation changes
   - User actions update navigation state

3. **Theme Preferences**
   - Theme store manages theme preferences
   - Components adapt to theme changes
   - User preferences are persisted

## User Interface Elements

### Main Heading
- Large, bold text: "Your Travel Plans and Travel Memories"
- Subtitle: "All in One Place"
- Centered at the top of the main content area

  - Action buttons stack vertically

- **Tablet** (640px - 1023px)
  - Navigation shows critical items
  - Feature cards in 2-column grid
  - Action buttons side-by-side

- **Desktop** (â‰¥ 1024px)
  - Full navigation bar
  - Feature cards in 2-column grid
  - Action buttons side-by-side
  - Wider content area

## Accessibility Considerations
