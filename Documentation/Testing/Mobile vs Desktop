The travel planner application is built with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, providing optimized experiences for both mobile and desktop users. Here's how the mobile and desktop versions differ and how you can test them:

Mobile vs. Desktop Differences

Touch-optimized controls with larger tap targets
Simplified map views for smaller screens
Optimized image loading for mobile data connections
Bottom navigation bars for key actions
Desktop Version
Expanded layouts with multi-column content
Persistent navigation menu at the top
Larger map displays with more visible details
Horizontal layouts for trip cards and destination lists
Hover states and keyboard shortcuts
Side panels for editing while viewing main content
More detailed data visualization for budgets and planning
