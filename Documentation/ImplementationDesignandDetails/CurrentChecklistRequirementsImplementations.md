## Implementation Details

### Payment Due Notifications

The payment due notification system works by:

1. **Scanning accommodation records**

   - Identifies payments due within 2 days
   - Identifies overdue payments not marked as paid

2. **Notification creation**
   - Creates notifications with appropriate urgency level
   - Sets notification type as `payment_reminder`
   - Includes payment amount and due date in message

3. **Continuous reminders**
   - For overdue payments, continues to send reminders
   - Reminders stop when `initialPaymentPaid`, `nextPaymentPaid`, or `finalPaymentPaid` is updated to `true`
   - Frequency of reminders configurable via admin settings

### Checklist Item Selection Improvements

To address the issue of default items not showing in "Select Items":

1. **Enhanced Loading Logic**
   - Query applicable default items based on entity type
   - Filter based on specific applicableTypes
   - Respect category and subcategory hierarchy

2. **Organized Display**
   - Group items by category and subcategory
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Multi-select UI with checkboxes

3. **Context-Aware Filtering**
   - When selecting items for a specific entity, only show relevant items
   - For accommodations, only show accommodation-related items
   - For transportation, respect transportation types

### Category Indication Enhancement

For improved checklist identification:

1. **Enhanced Display Format**
   - Format: "Checklist Name [Category - Entity Name]"
   - Smaller font for category information
   - Visual separation between name and category

2. **Implementation**
   - Modified dropdown component to include category info
   - Formatted strings in checklist service
   - Consistent application across all checklist selection UIs

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Default Items Not Appearing
- **Problem**: Default items defined in admin dashboard were not appearing in the "Select Items" dialog
- **Solution**: Fixed the query to properly filter by applicableTypes and include all relevant categories

### Challenge: Entity Association
- **Problem**: Checklists needed to be properly associated with specific entities
- **Solution**: Added entity reference fields to checklists table and ensured proper filtering in queries

### Challenge: Hierarchical Display
- **Problem**: Flat list of items was hard to navigate
- **Solution**: Implemented hierarchical category structure and grouped items by category in the UI

### Challenge: Payment Notification Timing
- **Problem**: Accommodation payments needed advance notification
- **Solution**: Implemented a dedicated job that scans for upcoming payments and creates timely notifications

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Default Item Selection**
   - Create a new checklist for different entity types
   - Verify that appropriate default items appear
   - Verify that items are properly organized by category

2. **Multi-Select Functionality**

   - Verify ability to select multiple items
   - Verify that selected items are added to the checklist

3. **Payment Notifications**
   - Create accommodation with payment due date
   - Verify notification appears 2 days before due date
   - Verify continuous reminders after due date
   - Mark payment as paid and verify reminders stop

4. **Category Indication**
   - Create checklists for different entity types

## Conclusion

The implemented checklist system provides a comprehensive solution for travelers to organize and track their preparation tasks. With entity-specific checklists, hierarchical categories, and smart notification features, users can ensure they're prepared for every aspect of their trip. The payment notification system adds an extra layer of financial organization, helping users stay on top of accommodation payments and avoid late fees.
